Don't use. Let me first test it in production.

This branch targets amp v1 packages and does not implement all Twitter API endpoints.

The master branch will target amp v2 packages and will have complete support of the Twitter API endpoints.

With the v2 branch active development of the v1 taregt will also cease. If you cannot upgrade and you need a specific feature on the v1 branch feel free to open an issue and I will add it to the v1 branch.

For all other development please target the matser branch.
